# llamaparse-go

A simple library for interacting with the LlamaParse API.

## Information

I've only written this for use in my other project, [suri](https://github.com/X3NOOO/suri), so it is VERY simple. It only exports a single function, not even a struct. As long as it works I'm not planning on rewriting it, but if you wish to do so pull requests are open.
